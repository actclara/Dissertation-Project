About the Project: 

The file above contains code to build a multimodal churn prediction for fashion rental services using LDA and BERTopic as the two modelling approaches. 
A benchmark model, using only Logistic Regression, is applied to test whether the inclusion of review-based topic features have high predictive power to classifying churn. 
Logistic Regression is used as the machine classifier for all the model variants to classify whether a customer churns or not, extracting features from 
topic features identified from LDA and BERTopic as well as structured information (e.g. age, height, size).
