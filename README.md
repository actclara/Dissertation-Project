About the Project: 

The file above contains code to build a multimodal churn prediction for fashion rental services using LDA and BERTopic as the two modelling approaches. Logistic Regression is used as the machine classifier to classify whether a customer churns or not 
based on the topic features identified from LDA and BERTopic as well as structured information (e.g. age, height, size).
